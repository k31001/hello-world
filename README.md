# Understanding Semiconductor Companies (for Investor)

"Good morning everyone. My name is Eric and I'm from Memory Division and responsible for SSD controller development. As you can see on the screen, I want to talk about Semiconductor Companies for Inverstor. In my presentation I'll focus on three main points. 

First of all I'll shortly introduce the industry trend. Then I'll explain supply chains of semiconductor companies for better understanding of this area. Finally, I'll end with offering strategies for inverstor.

It should take around 10 minutes to cover these points. 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me during my presentation."

So, let's get started.

### Script:
"Let's begin by taking a look at global semiconductor industry revenue growth."

"The semiconductor industry is growing rapidly. In 2022, it was worth $573 billion, and by 2030, it’s expected to reach $1 trillion. It means that we can get a lot of money by investing this area."

"That's all I want to say on this slide."

"Let's now move on to the applications."

"Semiconductors are essential for AI, electric cars, IoT, and 5G technologies. Let's take a look at the pie chart. As you can see, AI occupies 30% of the application followed by automotive occupied 25%. And consumer eleteronics with 20%, IoT with 15% and 5G communication system occupies 10%."

"I've give you a brief overview of semiconductor industry."

"That leds me to the next point, which is major players in this industry."

## Major Players of Semiconductor Industry

### Kyer Points:
1. **TSMC**
   - TSMC dominates over 50% of the global foundry market

2. **NVIDIA**
   - NVIDIA leads AI-releated GPUs with an 85% market share.

3. **Samsung**
   - Samsung holds a 40% market share in memory chips.

### Script:
"On this slide, we see three main companies in the semiconductor industry. First is TSMC, which holds a huge 50% of the market. TSMC is the world’s largest chip manufacturer, producing the most advanced semiconductors for smartphones and computers.

Next, NVIDIA leads AI-related GPU with 85% market share. NVIDIA is known for its GPUs, which are critical for gaming and AI.

Lastly, Samsung has 40% of the market share in memory chips like DRAM and NAND flash.

These numbers show how a few companies control most of the market, influencing prices, technology, and the industry’s direction.

Next, we’ll dive into the semiconductor supply chain."

## Supply Chain in Semiconductor Industry

### Key Points:
1. **Fab-less Companies**:
   - NVIDIA, Qualcomm, AMD, ARM, Apple.
2. **Foundry Companies**:
   - TSMC
   - Samsung
   - Intel
3. **Equipment Makers**:
   - ASML
   - Applied Materials
4. **EDA Tool Makers**:
   - Synopsys
   - Cadence
   - Siemens

### Script:
"The semiconductor industry relies on four main different types of company.

The first type is fabless. The fabless companies like NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Apple, ARM, and AMD focus on designing chips but outsource manufacturing to foundry companies. 

Foundries such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel handle production, using advanced technology to create smaller, faster, and more power efficienty chips. They have to buy incredibly expensive equiments for manufacturing from Equipment makers. 

Equipment makers like ASML and Applied Materials provide the machines for manufacturing. Among them, ASML holds dominent position accounting for more than 50% of the market share.

Finally, EDA tool makers like Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens supply the software tools for designing complex chips quickly and effectively. 

In summary, these players work together as a team, driving the growth of the semiconductor industry.

"I've talked about supply chain. Understanding it is very important to make better investment decisions."

"Finally, let me move on to the strategies."

## Investment Strategies

### Key Points:
1. **Direct Stock Investment**:
   - Examples: TSMC, NVIDIA.
2. **ETF Investment**:
   - Semiconductor-focused ETFs: SOXX, SMH.
3. **Diversification**:
   - Balance semiconductor investments with other sectors.
4. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Hold stocks for at least **5 years** for compounding growth.

### Script:
"Understanding key strategies also can help you make smart decisions. One simple way is through direct stock investments in top companies like TSMC and NVIDIA. Another option is ETF investments, such as SOXX and SMH, which give you spread-out the risks. Specifically, diversification is very important in order to reduce risks by balancing semiconductor stocks with other sectors."

"Last but not least, a long-term holding strategy is important. By holding semiconductor stocks for at least five years, you can make profit, even in a fluctuating market situation."

"Eventually, we have discussed all the key points: industry trends, supply chain, and strategies. Let’s move on to the conclusion."

## Conclusion

### Key Points:
- Huge growth potential – $1 trillion market by 2030.
- Key players in the supply chain – fabless companies and foundries.
- Stay informed – research helps you make better decisions.
- Investing in semiconductors means joining the future of technology."

### Script:
"Semiconductor investing offers significant opportunities, with the market projected to reach approximitely $1 trillion by 2030.

And we need to understand supply chain and we have to remind key players for each types of company. 

Long-term investment can also make profits in a fluctuating stock market.

And please continue researching to stay updated on industry trends.

Finally, please remember, investing in semiconductors is not just about making money—it’s about being part of technological revolution."
