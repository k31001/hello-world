# Understanding Semiconductor Companies (for Inverstor)

"Good morning everyone. My name is Eric and I'm from Memory Division and responsible for SSD controller development. As you can see on the screen, I want to talk about Semiconductor Companies for Inverstor. In my presentation I'll focus on three main points. 

First of all I'll shortly introduce current status of semiconductor industry and future trend. Then I'll be explaining different types of semiconductor companies for better understanding of this area. Finally, I'll end with offering recommendations for inverstor.

It should take around 10 minutes to cover these points. 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me during my presentation."

So, let's get started.

## Major Players of Semiconductor Industry

### Kyer Points:
1. **TSMC**
   - TSMC dominates over 50% of the global foundry market

2. **NVIDIA**
   - NVIDIA leads AI-releated GPUs with an 85% market share.

3. **Samsung**
   - Samsung holds a 40% market share in memory chips.

### Script:
"On this slide, we see three main companies in the semiconductor industry. First is TSMC, which holds a huge 50% of the market. TSMC is the world’s largest chip manufacturer, producing advanced semiconductors used in everything from smartphones to high-performance computers.

Next, NVIDIA leads AI-related GPU with 85% market share. NVIDIA is known for its GPUs, which are critical for gaming, artificial intelligence, and deep learning.

Lastly, Samsung has 40% of the market share in DRAM and NAND memory chips.

These numbers show how a few companies control most of the market, influencing prices, technology, and the industry’s direction.

Next, we’ll dive into the semiconductor supply chain."

## Supply Chain in Semiconductor Industry

### Key Points:
1. **Fab-less Companies**:
   - NVIDIA, Qualcomm, AMD, ARM, Apple.
2. **Foundry Companies**:
   - TSMC
   - Samsung
   - Intel
3. **Equipment Makers**:
   - ASML
   - Applied Materials
4. **EDA Tool Makers**:
   - Synopsys
   - Cadence
   - Siemens

### Script:
"The semiconductor industry relies on four main types of companies working together. Fabless companies like NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Apple, ARM, and AMD focus on designing chips but outsource manufacturing to save costs and innovate faster. Foundries such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel handle production, using advanced technology to create smaller, faster, and more powerful chips. Equipment makers like ASML and Applied Materials provide the machinery needed for manufacturing, driving efficiency and supporting growing demand. Finally, EDA tool makers like Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens supply the software tools use to design complex chips quickly and effectively. Together, these players form a dynamic ecosystem that powers the semiconductor industry."

"I've covered supply chain of semiconductor industry. Understanding supply chain is one of the most important for better investment."

"Finally, let me now turn to strategies for inversting in semiconductor industry."

## Investment Strategies

### Key Points:
1. **Direct Stock Investment**:
   - Examples: TSMC, NVIDIA.
2. **ETF Investment**:
   - Semiconductor-focused ETFs: SOXX, SMH.
3. **Diversification**:
   - Balance semiconductor investments with other sectors.
4. **Long-Term Strategy**:
   - Hold stocks for at least **5 years** for compounding growth.

### Script:
"Investing in semiconductors offers great opportunities in today’s market, and understanding key strategies can help you make smart decisions. One simple way is through direct stock investments in top companies like TSMC and NVIDIA. Another option is ETF investments, such as SOXX and SMH, which give you spread-out investments in the semiconductor sector for reducing risk. Speaking of risk, diversification is important. Balancing with other sectors can protect your portfolio from market volatility."

"Last but not least, a long-term holding strategy is important. By holding semiconductor stocks for at least five years, you can make profit, even in a fluctuating market."

"Finally, we have discussed all the key points. Let’s move on to the conclusion."
